# IP Address Fetcher

This project is a simple IP Address Fetcher application built using React.js. It retrieves the user's public IP address by making an API request to the "ipify" service and displays it on the screen. The application includes an additional feature that provides a link to IP2Location, allowing users to explore location information related to their IP.
